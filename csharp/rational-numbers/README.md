# Rational Numbers

A rational number is defined as the quotient of two integers `a` and `b`, called the numerator and denominator, respectively, where `b != 0`.

The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.

The sum of two rational numbers `r1 = a1/b1` and `r2 = a2/b2` is `r1 + r2 = a1/b1 + a2/b2 = (a1 * b2 + a2 * b1) / (b1 * b2)`.

The difference of two rational numbers `r1 = a1/b1` and `r2 = a2/b2` is `r1 - r2 = a1/b1 - a2/b2 = (a1 * b2 - a2 * b1) / (b1 * b2)`.

The product (multiplication) of two rational numbers `r1 = a1/b1` and `r2 = a2/b2` is `r1 * r2 = (a1 * a2) / (b1 * b2)`.

Dividing a rational number `r1 = a1/b1` by another `r2 = a2/b2` is `r1 / r2 = (a1 * b2) / (a2 * b1)` if `a2 * b1` is not zero.

Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a non-negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (a^n)/(b^n)`.

Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.

Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.

Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.

Implement the following operations:

- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,

- absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.

Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms. For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc. To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.

Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.

## Hints  

This exercise requires you to write an extension method. For more information, see [this page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/bb383977.aspx).

This exercise also requires you to write operator overloading methods for +, -, * and / operators. For more information, see [this page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5tk49fh2.aspx).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Initially, only the first test will be enabled. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.
Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution
using `exercism submit RationalNumbers.cs`
